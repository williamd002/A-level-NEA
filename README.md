This is all of the code that was for my (William Puchy's) Computer Science A-Level Non Exam Assessment.
Unfortunately the Non Exam Assessments are not going to be moderated for this academic year,
so there is not much point in finishing the coding off.
This project was started on September the 2nd officially and has had many hours of work put into it.
It is a shame that nothing on it will be marked - however I hope that it will be used somewhere.
It was fun to work on this with the interesting aspects of the code such as the SQL and networking side of it
I do hope that someone one day will find this and decide to keep going with it and make it into a fully functioning system

If you do use the code in this repository - please credit the person who made it.
